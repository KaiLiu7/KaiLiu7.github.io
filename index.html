        <h1>Kai Liu's Personal Homepage</h1>
        
        <p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Central Florida (UCF), where I have been conducting research under the supervision of Prof. Deguang Han
            since 2019. Alongside my studies, I serve as a Teaching Associate at UCF, delivering courses such as Calculus II, Calculus III, Ordinary Differential Equations,
            Linear Algebra, and other foundational undergraduate classes. Prior to this, I completed my graduate studies at Beijing Institute of Technology, working with Prof. Lining Jiang
            from 2016 to 2019.<p>

        <p> My research is focused on the fields of quantum computing and quantum information theory, with a particular emphasis on leveraging advanced mathematical frameworks to deepen our understanding
            of quantum systems. Specifically, I work on the development and application of mathematical tools—including frame theory, representation theory, and operator theory—to analyze
            and describe the structural properties and dynamics of quantum channels, quantum entanglement, and quantum error correction. My goal is to bridge mathematical theory and quantum mechanics,
            translating complex mathematical principles into practical insights that can reveal fundamental aspects of quantum systems and inform the design of quantum algorithms.
            Through this approach, I aim to contribute to the broader understanding of quantum information processing and advance the potential applications of quantum computing.<p>
        
        <p>Listed below are the recent activities, papers and manuscripts. </p>
